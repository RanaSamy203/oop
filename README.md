This project was developed as part of the OOP course at the Faculty 
of Computers and Artificial Intelligence, Cairo University.

Our team implemented a complete image-processing application that 
applies various filters to digital images using the Image class 
provided in "Image_Class.h". The program is fully menu-driven and 
allows users to load an image, choose from multiple filters, and 
save the edited result in different formats.

Throughout this project, we successfully implemented around twelve 
filters, including: 
Black & White, Grayscale, Flip (horizontal & vertical), Cropping, 
Resizing, Lighten/Darken, Adding Frames, Blur, Oil Paint, Merge, 
and the Old TV (Den Den Mushi).
