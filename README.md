This project was developed as a part of the OOP course at the Faculty of Computers and Artificial Intelligence, Cairo University.

Our team implemented a comprehensive image-processing application that applies various filters to images using the Image class provided in "Image_Class.h". The program is fully menu-driven and allows users to load an image and interact with the program, choose from multiple filters, and be able to save the edited result in different formats.

Throughout this project, we successfully implemented around twelve filters, including: Black & White, Grayscale, Flip (horizontal & vertical), Cropping, Resizing, Lighten/Darken, Adding Frames, Blur, Oil Paint, Merge, and the Old TV (Den Den Mushi).
